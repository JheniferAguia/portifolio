            <p class="apresentacao_conteudo_texto">My name is Jhenifer, I was born and currently live in Uberlândia, in the state of Minas Gerais, 
                I have been to many places in my life, I have had many cultural experiences and professions until I found my passion, 
                which is programming in the area.</p>
            <p class="apresentacao_conteudo_texto">I really fell in love with the programming area when I started a small game programming course, 
                but this small course proved to be incomplete, as I wanted to learn much more about the entire technology area. After thinking 
                a lot, I chose to go to college before entering the field, which led me to do a lot of research to choose a course that would 
                suit me. After a lot of research, I ended up finding and choosing the Computer Engineering course, as this course not only 
                teaches about the software part, but also teaches about the hardware part.</p>
